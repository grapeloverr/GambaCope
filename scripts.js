<think> Okay, let's see. The user asked for a continuation of the code for a slot machine game. They previously provided the index.html, scripts.js, and part of styles.css but got cut off. Now they're saying "go on," so they need the rest of the CSS and maybe any missing parts.
First, I need to check where the previous message ended. The styles.css was incomplete, ending with the .slot-container selector. The user needs the complete CSS to make the game look right. Also, maybe the JavaScript in scripts.js was fully provided, but I should verify.

Looking at the code provided, the styles.css was cut off. The user needs the rest of the CSS to ensure all the styling elements like grid, animations, buttons, etc., are properly styled. Without the full CSS, the layout and animations won't work as intended.

I should continue the CSS from where it left off. The .slot-container was started but not completed. Then proceed to define styles for .game-panel, .info-panel, .slot-grid, .slot-cell, animations like spin and win effects, control panel elements, buttons, hover effects, and responsive design for mobile.

Also, check if any parts of the JavaScript were cut off. In the previous response, scripts.js seems complete with functions for initializing the grid, spinning, animations, checking wins, updating balance and multiplier, etc. But it's good to confirm that all necessary parts are there.

Another consideration: the audio elements in index.html reference external URLs. The user might need to host those sounds or replace them, but that's beyond the current scope. Maybe mention it in a note.

Ensure that all classes mentioned in HTML (like .slot-cell, .win-animation) have corresponding styles in CSS. For example, .win-animation might have a glowing effect or color change.

Also, check for any missing interactive elements or dynamic behaviors in JavaScript. For instance, the changeBet function in scripts.js seems incomplete; it adjusts currentBet but doesn't update the display. The user might need to add code to update the bet amount displayed on the page.

Wait, in the JavaScript, the changeBet function is defined but doesn't update the DOM element showing the bet amount. So in the HTML, there's a span with id "bet-amount" that needs to be updated when currentBet changes. So in the changeBet function, after adjusting currentBet, there should be a line like document.getElementById('bet-amount').textContent = currentBet; Also, ensure that currentBet doesn't go below BASE_BET or exceed balance.

Another thing: in startSpin(), there's a check if balance < currentBet to prevent spinning when funds are low. However, when changing bets using changeBet(), it should also ensure that currentBet doesn't exceed balance. So in changeBet(), after adjusting currentBet, add a check like if (currentBet > balance) currentBet = Math.max(BASE_BET, balance); or similar.

Additionally, in the CSS, keyframe animations for spinning and winning need to be defined. For example, @keyframes spin for column animation and @keyframes winPulse for winning symbols.

Responsive design: The user wanted mobile responsiveness. So media queries in CSS for smaller screens to adjust font sizes, padding, grid gaps etc.

Putting it all together: Continue writing the CSS from where it was cut off, ensuring all classes are styled correctly. Then check JavaScript functions for completeness and add necessary updates to DOM elements where missing. Provide notes about potential improvements or dependencies like external audio files.
